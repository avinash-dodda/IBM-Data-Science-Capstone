# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

This project explores, segments and clusters the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. Following are the steps followed.

* For the Toronto neighborhood data, we scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and transform the data into a pandas dataframe
* We then get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood and append to the dataframe
* Finally we use KMeans to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto

All code is availabel in "Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto.ipynb" notebook

**Note:** Image outputs are stored as separate .jpg files.
