## Introduction: Business Problem

Sarah is a new Real Estate agent in City of Toronto. She has recently setup her agency business in the city. Dave, a good friend of Sarah, is looking to buy a new home for his family in Toronto. He approached Sarah for **advice on potential neighborhoods to buy a new home**. After preliminary discussion with Dave, Sarah came up with the following **criteria of neighborhoods** that Dave wants to by a home in.

- As Dave works in Downtown, he needs the neighborhood to be **well connected with transportation access to Downtown**
- Dave often likes to go dining out with his family, so he would like the neighborhood to have **variety of Restaurants**
- Finally Dave is concerned about safety of his family and wants to live in a **relatively safe neighborhood**

Sarah's objective, **as a key stakeholder of the business**, is to identify and recommend to Dave, **the target audience**, all the suitable neighborhoods according to his criteria. To achieve this, Sarah has sought to data science to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on the criteria. Additionally, the information gained through this exercise could help Sarah in advising **other potential new home buyers**, who have similar criteria and build the clientele of her new business in City of Toronto.
